# Simple Stopwatch

This is a basic stopwatch application that provides three controls: start, stop, and reset. It displays time in the format "hours:minutes:seconds".

## Controls

- **Start**: Initiates the stopwatch from 00 seconds.
- **Stop**: Pauses the stopwatch at its current time.
- **Reset**: Resets the stopwatch to 00 seconds.

## Tech Stacks Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Usage

To use the stopwatch, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## How it Works

This stopwatch is built using fundamental web technologies - HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and Vanilla JavaScript for functionality. The start button triggers the timer, the stop button pauses it, and the reset button sets it back to 00 seconds.
